Final Project Design:
Main Function Algorithm:
1. Display a welcome message.
2. Initialize variables and data structures for storing the image.
3. Enter a loop for displaying the main menu: a. Display the main menu options: load a new image, display the current image, edit the current image, exit. b. Prompt the user to select an option. c. Based on the user's choice:
   * If "load a new image" is chosen: i. Prompt the user for the file name. ii. Attempt to read the contents of the image file.
   * If "display the current image" is chosen: i. Display the current image using the brightness-to-character mapping.
   * If "edit the current image" is chosen: i. Enter a loop for displaying the edit menu:
      * Prompt the user to select an edit option.
      * Based on the user's choice:
         * Perform the corresponding edit operation on the image.
         * Display the edited image.
         * Prompt the user to save the edited image to a file.
         * If the user agrees to save:
            * Prompt the user for a file name.
            * Save the edited image to the specified file.
            * Exit the edit menu loop.
         * Return to the edit menu loop.
   * If "exit" is chosen: i. Exit the program.
Function Algorithms:
1. Load Image Function: loadImage()
   * Inputs: File name
   * Output: Image data structure
   * Algorithm:
      1. Open the specified file.
      2. Read the contents of the file and store them in an appropriate data structure representing the image.
      3. Close the file.
      4. Return the image data structure.
      5. 2. Display Image Function: displayImage()
   * Inputs: Image data structure
   * Output: None
   * Algorithm:
      1. Loop through the image data structure.
      2. Map each brightness value to its corresponding character according to the provided table.
      3. Display the characters to represent the image.
3. Crop Function: Crop()
   * Inputs: Image data structure, crop coordinates
   * Output: Cropped image data structure
   * Algorithm:
      1. Extract the specified portion of the original image based on the provided coordinates.
      2. Return the cropped image data structure.
4. Dim Function: Dim()
   * Inputs: Image data structure
   * Output: Dimmed image data structure
   * Algorithm:
      1. Decrease the brightness value of each pixel by one step.
      2. Return the dimmed image data structure.
5. Brighten Function: Brighten()
   * Inputs: Image data structure
   * Output: Brightened image data structure
   * Algorithm:
      1. Increase the brightness value of each pixel by one step.
      2. Return the brightened image data structure.
